						<h2>introduction</h2>
						<p>With over 70% of search click-through going to search results pages, it is imperative that
							you hire a professional company whose search service is consistent at producing high
							rankings for their clients. At Matrix Infoweb our Search Specialists deliver ethical,
							innovative
							techniques and comprehensive solutions that provide a focused commitment to your online
							marketing success.</p>
						<p>Many people and seo companies believe search optimization is about fixing some meta tags or
							other page code, and that is the end of it. This is one of many search engine myths. We know
							that search engine optimization is not merely about fixing meta tags or page code. Of
							course, this is a first step, but in most cases it is not enough.</p>
